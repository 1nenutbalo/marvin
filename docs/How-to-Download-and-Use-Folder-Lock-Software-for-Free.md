## How to Use Folder Lock?
 
Folder Lock has a user-friendly interface that allows you to easily access its features and functions. Here are some of the main things you can do with Folder Lock:

- **Lock Files:** You can drag and drop any file or folder into the "Lock Files" section of Folder Lock to password-protect it. You can also right-click on any file or folder and select "Lock with Folder Lock" from the context menu. Once locked, the files or folders will become inaccessible to anyone without the correct password.
- **Encrypt Files:** You can create encrypted lockers in the "Encrypt Files" section of Folder Lock to store your confidential files and folders. These lockers are encrypted with 256-bit AES encryption, which is one of the strongest encryption standards available. You can also sync these lockers with your cloud storage accounts (such as Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.) for online backup and security.
- **Backup Files:** You can backup your encrypted lockers to a secure online account in the "Backup Files" section of Folder Lock. This way, you can restore your data in case of loss or theft of your device. You can also access your data from any device by logging into your online account.
- **Shred Files:** You can permanently delete any file or folder in the "Shred Files" section of Folder Lock. This feature overwrites the data multiple times with random bits, making it impossible to recover or restore. This is useful for disposing of sensitive data that you no longer need.
- **Clean History:** You can erase all traces of your online and offline activities in the "Clean History" section of Folder Lock. This feature cleans your browser history, cookies, cache, temporary files, clipboard data, recent documents, recycle bin, etc. This helps you protect your privacy and free up disk space.
- **Create Wallets:** You can create virtual wallets in the "Create Wallets" section of Folder Lock to store your personal information such as 0f148eb4a0
